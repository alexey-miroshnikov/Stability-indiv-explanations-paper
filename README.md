# Stability-indiv-explanations-paper

This repository is devoted to the paper titled **Stability of game-theoretic feature explanations for machine learning models**. The paper is based on the first half of the preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10878v6 (the second half will appear as an independent paper). The PDF files of the paper and its relevant supplemental material are available in the main folder. The codes are for the numerical examples outlined in the first section of the supplemental material which demonstrate the stability results established in the paper.
